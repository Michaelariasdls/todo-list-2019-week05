# Project: Todo List

### Goal: Build a To-do-list

This project was a Todo list where you can write tasks that need to be completed, create & remove any that are either done or need to be changed.

### How it's Made:
Tech used:  HTML, CSS, Javascript

I took inspiration from a simple grocery list that anyone would make


### Optimizations


### Lessons learned
I learned alot about different methods & functions used such as removeChild & createElement & style.list to make the completed tasks underline.
